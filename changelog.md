At this point, Impart is really taking shape and I am looming closer to finishing HTML/CSS generation. Scripting events is still being researched, as I need to find the quickest way to transfer the events directly to the server with only C#. Website hosting is complete and the developer is able to easily host a webserver and switch between webpages.

  <li>No more developer HTML/CSS interaction</li>

Impart is expanding to API and networking along with general formatting now. Website functionality is put on hold as I further develop the networking portion of Impart. Everything is sanitized with the exception of attributes, but I will eventually find a way to fix that. More juicy updates to come as I include more and more features to make Impart a fair contender with the existing ASP.NET.
