At this point, Impart is really taking shape and I am looming closer to finishing HTML/CSS generation. Scripting events is still being researched, as I need to find the quickest way to transfer the events directly to the server with only C#. Website hosting is complete and the developer is able to easily host a webserver and switch between webpages.

Added:
<ul>
  	<li>Website hosting</li>
  	<li>Website events</li>
  	<li>No more developer HTML/CSS interaction</li>
</ul>

Impart is expanding to API and networking along with general formatting now. Website functionality is put on hold as I further develop the networking portion of Impart. Everything is sanitized with the exception of attributes, but I will eventually find a way to fix that. More juicy updates to come as I include more and more features to make Impart a fair contender with the existing ASP.NET.

Added:
<ul>
	<li>JSON format</li>
	<li>REST api hosting</li>
	<li>SOAP api hosting</li>
	<li>Nested element</li>
</ul>

Impart has started to embrace a production-ready state. Lots of bug fixes and some big additions to the codebase are only the beginning. Additionally, I have drastically shortened the load times of WebPages with a simple, yet powerful caching system.

Added:
<ul>
	<li>Table element</li>
	<li>Standardised documentation</li>
	<li>Massive overhaul to element rendering</li>
	<li>Cache system in each rendered object</li>
	<li>Animation and framing system</li>
	<li>Attribute system for styling</li>
	<li>External attribute system for HTML attributes</li>
</ul>
