*previous plan for executing code in browser*

1. Generate code to .wasm module.

2. Generate javascript code to load and invoke each .wasm module.

3. Enjoy not needing to use stupid languages to make a competent web page :>

*new plan*

1. To compile the html/css to a .razor file.

2. Detect any code in the class containing the method that is used in the html.

3. Write the class code to the .razor file.

4. Create classes of methods for live DOM manipulation. (text editing, style editing, etc)
